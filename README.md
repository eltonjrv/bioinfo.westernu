# Customized RDP reference database
The original fasta file was downloaded from http://drive5.com/sintax/rdp_16s_v16_sp.fa.gz

Then, after uncompressing with "gunzip" command, we added, at the end of the file. the following 16S rRNA sequences from SILVA-DB, which are of interest in Vet Med and were missing at the original RDP file from Robert Edgar (Uparse developer):
>*Mycoplasma haemocanis*  (SILVA ID: H0HHaemo)
*Ehrlichia canis* (SILVA ID: I8UCani3)
*Anaplasma platys* (SILVA ID: IE3Plat5)
